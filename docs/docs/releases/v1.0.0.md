# Praecepta v1.0.0

bump: version 0.3.0 → 1.0.0
tag to create: v1.0.0
increment detected: MAJOR

## v1.0.0 (2026-02-23)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- Middleware classes are now pure ASGI (no longer extend
BaseHTTPMiddleware). The /healthz endpoint returns a richer JSON payload
with per-subsystem status. MiddlewareContribution default priority changed
from 500 to 400 (max is now 499). New lifespan hooks (persistence, auth,
taskiq) are auto-discovered and must be excluded in test fixtures that
don't have external services available.

### Fix

- infrastructure audit remediation — 42 findings across 8 phases
